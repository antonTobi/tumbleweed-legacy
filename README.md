This is a simple editor for the game of Tumbleweed: [tumbleweed.4tc.xyz](https://tumbleweed.4tc.xyz/)

### Playing
You can place alternating legal moves by clicking on the board. To pass or undo use the buttons to the left of the board.

### Editing

Use backspace to remove stacks, or any of these keys to place stacks of different heights and colors:

|       | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| red   | q | w | e | r | t | y | u | i |
| white | a | s | d | f | g | h | j | k |
| gray  | z | x | c | v | b | n | m | , |

7-stacks behave identically as 6-stacks, but are shown as blank. This may be useful to create some diagrams.

### Sharing
To share the current position, click the "Link" button and then copy the new url.

### Visualization
There are some options to help visualize the position:

Influence: shows which player has more control over each empty hex.
Lines of sight: draws lines from the move you're about to place to the other stacks it can see (only if "Next move" is enabled)
Captures: indicates stacks that can be captured.
Last move: marks the last move made.
Next move: shows the move you're about to place and its effect on the board.

### Gameplay options
0-stacks: Allows placement where you have no lines of sight.
Suicides: Allows suicidal moves.

<!-- ### AI
There is a basic weak AI built into the editor. Click the "AI move" button to make the AI play a move. Check "Autorespond" to make the AI respond to all your moves. -->
