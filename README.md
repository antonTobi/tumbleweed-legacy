### Playing
You can place alternating legal moves by clicking on the board. To pass or undo use the buttons to the left of the board.

### Editing

Use backspace to remove stacks, or any of these keys to place stacks of different heights and colors:

|       | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| red   | q | w | e | r | t | y | u | i |
| white | a | s | d | f | g | h | j | k |
| gray  | z | x | c | v | b | n | m | , |

7-stacks behave identically as 6-stacks, but are shown as blank. This may be useful to create some diagrams.

### Sharing
Use the "Link" button to create a link to the current position. Note that the tool is completely client-side, so there is no collaborative editing or playing unfortunately. The link simply let's everyone look at the same position for themselves and try out sequences on the board.

You can also right click the white area to the lower right of the board and choose "Copy image". This might be more convenient to share a quick diagram, for instance in Discord you can just Ctrl+V to share the copied image.

### Visualization options
- Influence: shows which player has more control over each empty hex.
- Lines of sight: draws lines from the move you're about to place to the other stacks it can see (only if "Next move" is enabled)
- Captures: indicates stacks that can be captured.
- Last move: marks the last move made.
- Next move: shows the move you're about to place and its effect on the board.

### Gameplay options
- 0-stacks: Allows placement where you have no lines of sight.
- Suicides: Allows suicidal moves.

<!-- ### AI
There is a basic weak AI built into the editor. Click the "AI move" button to make the AI play a move. Check "Autorespond" to make the AI respond to all your moves. -->
